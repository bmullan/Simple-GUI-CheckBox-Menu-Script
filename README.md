### Simple GUI CheckBox Menu script.

Simple GUI Bash Script using YAD to launch scripts/apps 

This creates a GUI from which you can select via a Check-Box which applications, scripts or commands to run.

The applications will all be web based but because they will each reside in their own LXD container
on the same 10.x.x.x subnet as the CIAB Remote Desktop containers (ciab-guac, cn1).

This script can be modified and used for many use-cases so I thought I'd make it available here.
